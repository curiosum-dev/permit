# Permit

Plain-Elixir, DSL-less, extensible, agent-agnostic authorization library for Elixir.

Originally briefed and announced in Michal Buszkiewicz's [Curiosum Elixir Meetup #5 in 2022](https://youtu.be/AvUPX6cAjzk?t=3997).


**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `permit` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:permit, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/permit>.
